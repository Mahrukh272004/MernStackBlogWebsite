 Here's a set of instructions:

Open Visual Studio Code: Open the Visual Studio Code application on your computer.

Split the Terminal:
Once Visual Studio Code is open, navigate to the menu bar.
Click on "Terminal" and then select "Split Terminal" to split the terminal into two separate instances.
Navigate to the MERN folder:
In one of the terminal panes, navigate to the MERN folder using the cd command. Assuming your MERN folder is located in your home directory, you might type:
cd path/to/mern
Replace path/to/mern with the actual path to your MERN folder.
Start the API Server:
Inside the terminal pane where you navigated to the MERN folder, navigate to the API folder by typing:
cd api
Then, start the API server by running:

npm start
Start the Client Application:
In the other terminal pane, navigate to the "client" folder within the MERN folder by typing:
cd client
Then, start the client application by running:
npm start
